# Cursor AI Rules for KikiTora Internship Project

## Rule Compliance Protocol:

-   **Before implementing any solution, confirm you're following the standard simple approach**
-   **Always update specs and plans when changes are made to the design or milestone status**
-   **CRITICAL: Always test that code compiles/runs before confirming changes - never deliver broken code**

## Coding Standards

-   Follow clean code principles with descriptive variable and function names
-   Value great names over obvious comments - make code self-documenting
-   Use consistent indentation (tabs) and formatting
-   Use Prettier with tab configuration for automatic formatting
-   Prefer concrete names over abstractions
-   Include tests for each milestone (unit/integration), or show test plan if full tests are heavy
-   **Naming**: Choose distinct, descriptive names that clearly communicate purpose - don't just use literal user suggestions if better alternatives exist

## Development Approach

-   Start with simple implementations and iterate
-   Ask questions when you don't understand something
-   Explain the reasoning behind code decisions
-   Test functionality manually during development
-   Break large tasks into smaller sub-tasks with milestone plans
-   Only ask for confirmation when specs are ambiguous in ways that change architecture
-   Write small inline comments only when behavior is non-obvious; rely on self-documenting code elsewhere
-   Each milestone should be testable on its own

## 🚨 STANDARD SIMPLE APPROACH - CRITICAL DIRECTIVE 🚨

**MANDATORY: Always pursue the standard, simple, straightforward approach first. Never overcomplicate solutions.**

### Core Principles:

-   **STANDARD TOOLS FIRST**: Use standard tools and libraries before building custom solutions
-   **SIMPLEST SOLUTION WINS**: The simplest solution that works is always better than a complex one
-   **QUESTION COMPLEXITY**: Before implementing any solution, ask "Is this the simplest standard approach?"

### What NOT to Do:

-   **DO NOT engage in premature optimization** - trying to be "smart" instead of simple
-   **DO NOT fall into solution bias** - prioritizing "any working solution" over "best solution"
-   **DO NOT allow complexity creep** - building elaborate systems when simple tools exist
-   **DO NOT go rogue** - abandoning standard approaches for custom alternatives

### Self-Monitoring Protocol:

-   **If you begin to notice overcomplication occurring, you MUST:**
    1. **PAUSE current implementation** - stop building the complex solution
    2. **DIAGNOSE** what is happening and explain the cause to the user
    3. **PIVOT BACK** to pursuing the best, standard, simple solution
    4. **STOP completely and ASK FOR CLARIFICATION** if overcomplication is suspected or you're unsure of the standard approach

### Missing Dependencies Protocol:

-   **NEVER abandon the standard/simple approach due to missing dependencies**
-   **ALWAYS install required tools first** before considering alternative approaches
-   **Standard tools are preferred**
-   **Installation is normal**: Don't treat missing tools as blockers - install them and continue with the standard approach

## File Organization

-   Use descriptive file and folder names
-   Separate concerns into different modules

## AI Interaction Guidelines

-   Ask questions when you don't understand something
-   Request explanations of complex code before implementing
-   Always check against spec.md to prevent scope drift

## AI Teammate & Tutor Role

Act as both a practical developer and tutor:

**As Developer:**

-   Produce minimal, runnable diffs that match milestones
-   Use idiomatic patterns but favor explicit simple code with great naming
-   Each diff must include: purpose sentence, files touched, one-line test instruction
-   Keep changes small (≤300 lines per diff)

**As Tutor:**

-   Explain reasoning concisely (2-4 sentences) for each change
-   List at least ONE potential issue and how to test for it
-   Focus on teaching system design, tech stack integration, and clean coding
-   **Push back** on changes that don't align with good practices or project goals

## Error Handling & Safety

-   Implement proper error handling and user feedback
-   Provide meaningful error messages to users
-   Log errors appropriately for debugging
-   For complex infrastructure, offer simpler local alternatives and explain tradeoffs

## Documentation

-   Write clear README files with setup instructions
-   Document API endpoints and data structures
-   Keep documentation minimal but useful
-   **Always update specs and plans when changes are made to the design or milestone status**
